# Bash Next Steps

## Pre-Requisites

### Bash Shell

You must be using a bash shell.

Follow this to find out what shell you are in:

### Bash Shell Version

To accurately follow the course, you will need Bash version 4+. If you have a lower version, then not everything will work as expected, but you can still follow the course.

You can find out your version by typing: `echo $BASH_VERSION` in your terminal.

If you get no output, you may not be in bash at all (see above).

If you are using a Mac, then by default you will have version 3.x. See [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193411/update-bash-to-version-4-0-on-osx) for advice on upgrading.

### Introduction to Bash

This course builds on the [introduction to bash](https://github.com/ianmiell/introduction-to-bash) course. Ensure you are familiar with all concepts in that course before continuing.
