1) Look at the DEBUG trap in the bash 'man' page and see how you can use it to help debug your scripts.

2) Look for the '\C-e' and '\C-r' bindings in the 'bind -p' output.

3) Go through your 'bind -p' and try and understand it as well as you can.

4) Research the terminal options' shortcuts in the `stty -e` table and what they mean.

5) Research the inputrc file and edit it to configure how `backward-kill-word` is invoked.

6) Write a script that tries to prevent the user leaving the script.

7) Go through these two programs:

- https://github.com/ianmiell/cheapci

- https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop/blob/master/bashtop

and try and understand each line in turn.

8) Write a script to run a series of useful housekeeping or reporting commands in the background, and then output a summary message at the end when they have all completed.
